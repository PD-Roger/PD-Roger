👋 Hi, I’m @PD-Roger
I’m a passionate hardware product designer with expertise in mechanical design, product development, and manufacturing processes. With years of experience in designing and optimizing consumer electronics, 
I specialize in creating innovative and functional solutions for complex product challenges.
👀 I’m interested in hardware product design, new product development, manufacturing technologies, DFMA (Design for Manufacturing and Assembly), injection molding, and material science. 
I'm always excited to explore new technologies and methods to improve product performance and streamline production.
🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced manufacturing processes, sustainable product design, and AI-assisted design tools. I'm constantly updating my skills to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech and design landscape.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hardware product development, mechanical design projects, and innovative product manufacturing. 
If you’re working on creating cutting-edge products or exploring new ways to streamline production, let’s connect!
